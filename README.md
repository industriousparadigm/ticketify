This should be a production grade application fully developed with a microservices architecture.

The juicy buzzwords associated with it are:

- Typescript
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- NextJS
- Google Cloud Platform
- MongoDB
- JWT
- NodeJS
- Express
- React
- Nginx
- Redis
- It's midnight and I want to go to bed

The application is built following Stephen Grider's new [Microservices course](https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-with-node-js-and-react). What amazing work by Mr. Grider.
